      <h2>about</h2>
      <p>It started with a question: Why is it so difficult to find gigs for indie OPM artists? Before, you couldn't find a website on the local music scene that's easily accessible and especially highlights indie artists. So, we decided to make that website ourselves.</p>
      <p>Originally a passion project in 2023, Gigs & Swigs was established with the goal of bringing local food and music to the forefront. Today, we are the most well-known art cafe & bar in Quezon City and have regular gigs from notable artists such Lola Amour, Munimuni, The Ridleys, and Ang Bandang Shirley.</p>
      <p>Everyday, we strive to make the local scene as celebrated as global mainstream media. Thus, we have opened our doors for local artists, from musicians, poets, writers, filmmakers, photographers, to many other creatives. We have always wished to provide a platform for artists to showcase their creativity; in fact, some of their work is exhibited inside our cafe and are sometimes up for selling.</p>
      <p>We have partnered with farmers and suppliers across the country for our comfort foods offered in the Gigs & Swigs cafe. Our location in Maginhawa is perfect for staying in or enjoying the scenery of the city—our recent partnership with Tabs & Slabs has even allowed us to fill our shelves with a diverse set of books you can read for free.</p>
      <p>We also regularly host private functions with the goal of making many simple occassions more memorable. Through us, you can even book private gigs of your favorite local artist. </p>
      <p>Collaborations with visual artists are also in the works to provide you with beautifully crafted designs featuring the busy streets of Metro Manila and its urban culture.</p>
      <p>We recognize the platforms that we have and are committed to using it to bring about positive change. We want to bring the community together to support and value local works. We believe that even with these small steps, we can make a big contribution to the way the local scene is seen.</p>
      <p>As you open the doors to our small space in Maginhawa, we hope you find a safe haven that helps you appreciate everything local.</p>
